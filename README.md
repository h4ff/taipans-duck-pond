# Duck Pond — v1.0.0

Duck Pond is the Taipans Cricket Club weekly duck animation. Player and duck data are loaded from CSV files and rendered as an interactive pond for desktop and mobile browsers.

## Production files

- `index.html` — application shell and cache-busted references
- `src/app.js` — pond behaviour, player/week logic and events
- `src/styles.css` — layout, animation and responsive styling
- `data/players.csv` — player presentation data
- `data/ducks.csv` — weekly duck events
- `assets/` — production artwork and sound
- `docs/` — design decisions, backlog, roadmap and release/security notes

## Data format

`data/players.csv`

```text
playerId,name,nickname,presentation,featherTone,build,president,captain,coach,hair,headwear,swimAccessory
```

`data/ducks.csv`

```text
date,playerId,team,duckType
```

Supported `duckType` values are `standard`, `golden` and `diamond`. Dates may be supplied as `D/M/YYYY`, `DD/MM/YYYY` or `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Club-week behaviour

The season is anchored to **28 Sep–4 Oct 2026**. Empty/washout weeks remain selectable. When duck data exists, the latest populated club week is selected by default.

## Hosting

The production build is suitable for static hosting on GitHub Pages. Treat everything committed to a public production repository, including CSV data and assets, as publicly accessible.

## v1.0.0 release

v1.0.0 is the production launch build promoted directly from the tested v0.183 release candidate. It includes the completed pre-release cleanup plus mobile portrait pond-scroll hints and the Facebook/Instagram in-app-browser landscape notice. No functional pond changes were made during the v1.0.0 promotion.
